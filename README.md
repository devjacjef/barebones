# `barebones`

This is a project aimed at building a minimal yet complete framework for building my own projects.

Knowledge I have gathered from different sources will be applied here to build a modern and clean framework following thoughtout design practices.

The goal is to show my working knowledge of PHP and understanding of Design Patterns and MVC architecture.

## Directory Structure

The structure is inspired by Symfony.

`assets` - CSS, JS.
`bin` - CLI Interface for the project.
`config` - Configuration for the project.
`public` - DocumentRoot?
`src` - Contains code for the application.
`tests` - Tests for the application.
`var` - Cache, Logs...
`views` - Templates/Pages for the application.

*tests should be executed on the server side*.
