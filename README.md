# `barebones`

This project is a learning exercise for me to learn better practices when developing with PHP and to build a foundation for future solo projects I work on.

The goal is to learn about PHP and to develop a framework show-casing my understanding of backend concepts.

A secondary goal is to try and pick up good practices whilst I develop this framework.
